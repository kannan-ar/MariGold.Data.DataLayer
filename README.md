<h1>MariGold.Data.DataLayer</h1>
<p>
Sometimes writing a Data Layer is a tedious task. It flooded with numerous functions to fetch results or excute from a given SQL. Using MariGold.Data.DataLayer, you can register an SQL with a name. That's it! You can results or execute registered SQL statments with the built-in functions from this library. It will save you from writing seperate functions for this!
